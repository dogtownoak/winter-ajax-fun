## Winter Break Ajax :christmas_tree:

### Directions: 

Clone down this repo and run:
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Delieverables: 

Your goal is to create a front end that uses all the built in CRUD features of this application. How you decide to style and design it is up to you. Inside of the Views and Public folder you find that everything is set up for you. All you need to do is edit the HTML, CSS and JS.

### Additional Challenges: 

Create a "Menu" model that takes in the following values:

- breakfastItems : Array[ref to food model]
- lunchItems : Array[ref to food model]
- dinnerItems : Array [ref to food model]

Create a "Restraunt" model that takes in the following values:

- name 
- hours
- Menu : ref to menu model
- location
- contactNumber

Add the CRUD functionality to the front end to view the new models you have created.
